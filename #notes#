1. Need to think about how do I actually want it to work in the end ?
   -What I need to type in order to get the result ?
   # First I call the script with (MAX and/or MIN).
   # Then There is a prompt for "Objective Func"
   # Type Objective func like dictionary
   # Prompt for "constraints"
   # Type constraints like dictionary OR BINARY
   #
